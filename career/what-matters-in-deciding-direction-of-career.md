- Today I read [an Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-does-it-feel-like-to-be-an-unemployed-PhD) that was written by a mathematics Ph.D.

- I realized that even though you are 100% convinced that you want to pursue your future in academia at a time, it can be changed as you face up with reality of being a gradudate.

- As the author of the answer said, now I have an belief that thing that matters when deciding your lifelong career should be problems that you want to solve, not jobs or schools.
