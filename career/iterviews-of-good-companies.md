- Today I learned that interviews in good companies usually put focus on
    algorithm(problem solving skills) and fundamental computer science
    (network, operating systems or software architecture) rather than on
    tech stack details.

- Today I learned that thus I should focus more on CS fundamentals and
    mathematic rather than on language / framework hipster shits.
